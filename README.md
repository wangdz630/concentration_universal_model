# Halo Mass Variance Calculator
# Calculate the linear growth factor
# Predicting halo formation and structure


##  Introduction

This code primarily serves two purposes:

1、To compute the linear growth factor ($D(z)$) , the root-mean-square (rms) fluctuation ($\sigma(M)$) of the linear density field for a halo of a given mass at z=0 under cosmological model.

2、To compute the linear growth factor ($D(z_\mathrm{f})$) of the formation epoch ($z_\mathrm{f}$, defined as the redshift at which the halo reaches half of its final mass at redshift $z$) of dark matter halos. Then to predict concentration of dark matter halos of any mass, at any redshift, and for any cosmology, by leveraging the linear growth factor and the rms fluctuation of the linear density field obtained in the first step in conjunction with our universal halo concentration model. In cases where $D(z_\mathrm{f})$ is not directly required, the halo formation epoch can be obtained from a semi-analytical model or another fitting formula for the halo mass accretion history (MAH).

##  File Structure

-  `growth_factor.py` - Linear growth factor calculation by solving second-order differential equations (ODE).

-  `cosmology_params.py` - Cosmological parameter configurations, users can incorporate their own desired cosmology into this function and then calculate the variance of the corresponding simulated dark matter halos.
-  `VarianceCalculator.py` - Core mass variance calculation class.
-  `halo_variance.py` - Main program for variance calculation.
-  `formation_and_structure.py` - Calculates the halo formation redshift and concentration based on the dark halo mass accretion history and structure model.
-  `README.md` - Documentation
-  `input_masses.dat` - The required dataset of halo virial mass ($M_{vir}$).
-  `output_rms.dat` - The dataset of the rms fluctuation of the linear density field of halo.
-  `halo_properties_z_cosmology.dat` - The dataset of the halo properties, in which contain $M_{vir}$, $\sigma(M)$, $D(z)$, $D(z_\mathrm{f})$ and concentration ($c_{vir}$)

##  Usage
First, you need to provide the halo mass `input_masses.dat` and the corresponding cosmological model `cosmology_params.py`. You can also add your desired cosmology in the `cosmology_params.py`. Then, use `growth_factor.py` and `halo_variance.py` to calculate $D(z)$ and $\sigma(M)$. Finally, use `formation_and_structure.py` to calculate the halo concentration parameters. The execution code is shown below.
